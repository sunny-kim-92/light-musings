Back in early October, after learning about [the GOAT-status records on tap for the incomparable Simone Biles](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/simone-biles-gymnastics-24th-medal-world-championship-beam-balance-gold), I tuned in for the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The vault period had just begun, and I marvled as the world's best completed flip after twist after landing. At point point, Elfi Schlegel complimented an elegant "Amanar". I realized I couldn't quite point out the difference between that vault and the "double-twisting Yurchenko" from right before, or the "Handspring layout 1.5" before that. As each vault came and went, my reactions rotated between the simple reactions of "That was a lot of twists", "That was a great landing", and "That was awesome". The performances were such a blur that I could never fully appreciate these monumental feats of athleticism.

Suffice it to say, I am the furthest thing from a gymnast. With that being said, it's been a consistent goal of mine to become a more informed gymnastics viewer, ever since the epic Shawn Johnson / Nastia Liukin battle at the 2008 Olympics. In pursuit of this, I developed a small program that allows users to explore the elements involved with a gymnastics vault, and build one of their own.

The governing international body for gymnastics (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique) lists 80 different vaults in their [Code of Points (CoP)](https://www.gymogturn.no/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CoP-2017-2020-1.pdf) for Elite Women's Artistic Gymnastics. For scoring and identification purposes, each vault is comprised of 5 distinct elements:


### Step 1 - Take-Off Direction
Refers to the position the gymnast is facing when leaping onto the platform.

<dire></dire>

### Step 2 - Pre-Flight Turns
Think twists! Officially referred to as "Longitudinal axis turns" in the CoP, turns are simply rotations made along a gymnast's vertical axis. During pre-flight, this corresponds with the period between the springboard and the apparatus.

<fturn></fturn>

### Step 3 - Saltos
Think somersaults or flips! Saltos are the official term for rotations made along a gymnast's axis across the waist.

<salto></salto>

### Step 4 - Body Position
Refers to the aligment of the gymnast's legs as he or she transitions from apparatus to landing.

<bp></bp>

### Step 5 - Flight Turns
Just like pre-flight turns, only these occur from apparatus to landing.

<sturn></sturn>

Note that not all combinations of these 5 elements create a valid vault. For example, out of the 80 vaults, only one (the Tucked Double Salto AKA Produnova AKA [Flying Circus of Death](https://balancebeamsituation.com/elite-skill-database/produnova/)) involves 2 saltos. The vault builder  accounts for compatible options as you move through the selections.
