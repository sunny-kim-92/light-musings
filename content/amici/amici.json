    "par1": "States play an important role in the litigation and outcome of Supreme Court cases. Amicus briefs provide a critical avenue of influence. These documents allow parties not directly involved with the case the ability to provide input on particular topics of legal interests that a given case covers. These texts are provided to Supreme Court Justices, who often cite these briefs during oral arguments and opinions. To analyze the breadth of states and their amicus filings, I explored amicus briefs filed by states during the October 2018 Supreme Court term. Through this, we can find a number of correlations both among states and between states and justices.",
    "par2": "Since I don’t have access to major legal database tools like LexisNexus or CaseText, I wrote a number of programs for accumulating the data used for this article. I chiefly used web-scraping techniques designed for SCOTUSblog.com. The code can be found here: https://github.com/sunny-kim-92/amici-link. The total accumulated raw data, as well as numerous charts and tables, detailing the data collected can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ms2JFLqjp2bGO2YD_4uz_V35Wy2kYkLSMb_2pixFb0/edit?usp=sharing.",
    "par3": "States filed on opposing sides of the same case only four times this term. In addition to the aforementioned Rucho v. Common Cause: North Carolina Department of Revenue v. The Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust challenged interpretations of residency as pertaining to a state’s right to collect taxes on trust income. The American Legion v. The American Humanist Society is the latest case involving the various tests measuring separation of church and state. The case concerned a 40-foot Latin Cross erected in Bladensburg, Maryland in 1925 as a memorial to fallen WWI veterans. Frank v. Gaos and Department of Commerce v. Southern District of New York, two other cases in which cases filed on opposing sides, were not included, as all or major portions of either case were remanded to lower courts with challenges left unsettled.",
    "par4": "We can attempt to measure the relationships between states and justices. Similar to our previous analysis, we can calculate a net score by finding the number of cases in which justices voted on the same side of a state subtracted by cases in which justices opposed states. We can take our investigation into these relationships a step further by finding a net proportion score. We take each net score and divide by the total number of cases in which a state filed, thus providing a simple normalized ratio consistent with each state’s total amicus briefs.",
    "par5": "Interestingly, in addition to a general correlation between justices and like-minded states, there is a broad trend of lower scores for liberal justices than those of conservative justices. This is perhaps a function of the conservative justices’ more favorable view towards federalism and the rights of states. Such cases prompt a larger, more unified response from states, and in turn provides a noticeable aggregate impact on the state-justice data.",
    "par6": "To measure the similarity of states in amici scores, I calculated a “co-morbidity”: a net score of cases in which states filed in support of the same side subtracted by cases in which states filed on opposing sides. Given that states filed on opposing sides on only 4 of the 28 cases, a negative co-morbidity score represents a particularly sharp divide in litigation this term."
